# MovieSearchApp

Our application will store movie data including title, year of release, movie rating, and genre based on the movie’s IMDB rating. Through our application, the user will be able to search for movies based on rating so as to get a list of movies which fulfil the user’s search criteria. Our application would be useful and be used by people who wish to pick out a movie to watch based off of the movie’s rating and subsequently be also able to get more information about the movie such as the movie’s genre, year of release, etc.
